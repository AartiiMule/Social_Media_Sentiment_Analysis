# Social_Media_Sentiment_Analysis

Goal of the Project: In this project, we aim to develop a Social Media Sentiment Analysis system to assist organizations, including platforms like Facebook and Twitter. The objective is to understand and analyze user sentiments, enabling the organization to better serve users by providing the information or objects they are searching for

       step which we did in this project 

first we import the required libraries
like pandas,numpy, seaborn , matplotlib, counter,wordcloud, tokenization, stopwords,punctuaction,contraction,unidecode,WordNetLemmatizer,CountVectorizer,TfidfVectorizer,speller and mainy more....
then we did 
DATA GATHERING : so in this project we gather the data form the kaggle
EXPLORATIRY DATA ANALYSIS : we check value counts, then we did ngrams,wordcloud to understand the data then we did text preprocessing 
TEXT PREPROCESSING : in that we remove the spaces, contraction mapping,then we handle the accented characters, we did tokenization, normalization , removing stopwords, remove special characters,then we did lemmatization then we go for the feature engineering.
FEATURE ENGINEERING : in that we covert text into numeric format we use count vectorizer,and tfidf technique.
MODEL BUILDING : in that we use four to five algorithm to fit our data 
like logistic regression, naivy bias , decision tree, random forest, adaboost , svm, k nearest neighbour and also we use hypeparameter tunig technique.
MODEL EVALUATION :we use classification evaluation metrics like accuracy_score , precison, recall, plot the confusion metric,clasdofication report
WEB DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK : we build API by using Flask. and also test it on postman.
